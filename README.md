# Imgcat
Display images in your iTerm2 terminal Windows.

## Description
Display an image in your terminal in `cat`-like way. This requires a recent
version of iTerm2 2.9 Beta in order to function. The `imgcat` script is taken
from the [iTerm 2 repository](https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2/blob/master/tests/imgcat)
and was released under the GPLv2 Copyleft license. This tap exists just to make
it easier to install.

## Installation
The normal homebrew tap and install routine will work

    $ brew tap colinstein/imgcat
    $ brew install imgcat

## Use
Treat it like a [useless use of cat](http://porkmail.org/era/unix/award.html#cat)

    $ imgcat foo.jpg
